# Facebook_imputation

This project developed an imputation method to deal with the missing Facebook data removed due to privacy protection measures. If a tile had a baseline or population number below ten for a specific time and date, both values are excluded, retaining only their percent change in the records.

Data collected during different time intervals should be processed separately.
